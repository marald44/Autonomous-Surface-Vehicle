# Autonomous Surface Vehicle for SSB ROBOIK competition
SSB ROBOIK competition was organized by the Defence Industry Agency (SSB) of Turkey.
I led a team of 10 to the top-four finish in the nationwide Autonomous Surface Vehicle competition in just six months. 
I deployed a real-time Computer Vision system with Object Detection and Color Recognition Machine Learning models using YOLO, OpenCV, and advanced image processing techniques such as image augmentation to achieve over 90% accuracy.
